- _**Summary:**_
I have started learn Front-End Development not so long ago. As I have already known Front-end web development is a great place to start your journey into the world of coding. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS from from Anna Block's course. I always strive to learn something new. I study hard and learn new materials fast. So that's why I'm gonna learn JavaScript, because JavaScript is a great language and it is incredibly practical to learn at some point in your programming experience.
